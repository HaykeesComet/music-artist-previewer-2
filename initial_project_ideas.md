## Capstone Two Project Ideas:

### 1. Complete Web Chat Application
This project will involve creating a full-featured web chat application where users can register, log in, and participate in real-time chat with other users. The application will support both private messaging and group chats. Users will also have the ability to manage their profiles, including updating their display names and avatars.

### 2. Music Artist Discography Search
This project will allow users to search for music artists and view detailed discographies, including albums, release dates, track listings, and album artwork. Users will also have the option to save their favorite artists and albums for quick access.

### 3. Build a Recipe App
This project will focus on creating a recipe app where users can search for recipes, view detailed instructions, and save their favorite recipes. The app will also allow users to create and share their own recipes, complete with ingredients, cooking steps, and photos.
